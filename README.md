### Projects & Networks
**A project:**
Assosiates objects and services with billing. Contains networks(quota max 5).
**A network:**
Has no IP ADDRESS RANGE.
Is global and spans all avaliable regions.
Contains subnetworks.
Can be of type defoult, auto mode, or custom mode.

_Auto mode network can be converted to custom mode network, but "once custom, always custom."_  

## IP Adresses
* DNS resolution for internal addresses

* Assign a range of IP addresses as ali

## Virtual Networks

* Cloud Virtual Networks(CVN), Projects, Networks, Subnetworks, IP addresses, Routes, Firewall rules.

## Virtual Machines

* GCE, tags, VM options, vCPUs, disk options, images, and special features of persistent
disks for VMs
